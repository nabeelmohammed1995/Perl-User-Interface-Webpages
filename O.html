<h1><strong>Operators</strong></h1>
<h3>Perl Arithmetic Operators:</h3><br/>
<h4>
+ Addition - Adds values on either side of the operator $a + $b<br/> 
- Subtraction - Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand $a - $b<br/> 
* Multiplication - Multiplies values on either side of the operator $a * $b<br/> 
/ Division - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand $b / $a<br/> 
% Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder $b % $a<br/> 
** Exponent - Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators $a**$b<br/> 
 </h4>
 <h3>Perl Equality Operators:</h3><br/>
 <h4>
 == Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true. ($a == $b) is not true.<br/> 
!= Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true. ($a != $b) is true.<br/>  
<=> Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, and returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the left argument is numerically less than, equal to, or greater than the right argument. ($a <=> $b) returns -1.<br/> 
> Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. ($a > $b) is not true.<br/>  
< Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. ($a < $b) is true.<br/>  
>= Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. ($a >= $b) is not true.<br/>  
<= Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true. ($a <= $b) is true.<br/>  
</h4>
<h3>Perl Assignment Operators:</h3><br/>
<h4>= Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand $c = $a + $b will assigne value of $a + $b into $c <br/>
+= Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand $c += $a is equivalent to $c = $c + $a <br/>
-= Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand $c -= $a is equivalent to $c = $c - $a <br/>
*= Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand $c *= $a is equivalent to $c = $c * $a <br/>
/= Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand $c /= $a is equivalent to $c = $c / $a <br/>
%= Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand $c %= $a is equivalent to $c = $c % a <br/>
**= Exponent AND assignment operator, Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand $c **= $a is equivalent to $c = $c ** $a <br/>

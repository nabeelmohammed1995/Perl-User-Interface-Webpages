<h1 align="center"><strong>Loops</strong></h1>
<h4>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.
<p>Perl programming language provides following types of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.<br/>

Loop Types:<br/>
Description<br/>
while loop- Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.<br/>
until loop- Repeats a statement or group of statements until a given condition becomes true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.<br/> 
for loop- Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.<br/>
foreach loop - The foreach loop iterates over a normal list value and sets the variable VAR to be each element of the list in turn.<br/> 
do...while loop -Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.<br/> 
nested loops -You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.<br/> 
<p>Loop Control Statements:<br/>
Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Control Statements:<br/>
Description:<br/>
next statement Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.<br/> 
last statement Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.<br/>  
continue statement A continue BLOCK, it is always executed just before the conditional is about to be evaluated again.<br/>  
redo statement The redo command restarts the loop block without evaluating the conditional again. The continue block, if any, is not executed.<br/>  
goto statement Perl supports a goto command with three forms: goto label, goto expr, and goto &name.<br/>
